Project Overview

At the moment I am developing a CRM application that automates everything from generating proposals to prospecting clients.

I’d like to hear more about the tasks you have in mind, so I can fully understand the context and help you reach your goal.

Areas for Improvement

Understood. I can review the automations and optimize performance.

Improving the user interface is also something I can help with—do you have any specific examples of what’s not working well for your team?

Clarification Requests

Sorry, could you repeat that, please?

Could you speak a bit slower, please?

Just to make sure I understood… are you saying that… [repita o que entendeu]?

Terminology Clarification

I'm not familiar with that term—can you explain it briefly?

Affirmations and Agreements

Absolutely, I can do that.

Com certeza, posso fazer isso.

That makes sense.

I totally agree.

Yes, that sounds like a good idea.

That’s definitely something I can help with.
      Let me think for a second…

Initial Assessment and Proposed Solution

That’s a good question.

Let me just make sure I give you the right answer.

I’d like to take a quick look at the app before giving a final answer.

We can create a simple workflow using AppSheet actions and Zapier.

Next Steps

Once I review the current setup, I can send you a short summary with suggestions.

Hourly Rate Disclosure

Sure, before we move forward, I’d like to mention my hourly rate. It’s one hundred dollars per hour.

Rate Justification

I see. Based on my experience and the type of work involved, I believe one hundred dollars per hour is a fair rate. But I’m happy to make sure we deliver good value for that.

It should take me no more than 7 to 10 days to complete everything.

Availability and Project Timeline

I'm currently working full-time at a company, so I’ll only be available for about one or two hours per day.

But I can take a look at the app and send you a proposal with an estimate of how much time the work will take.
